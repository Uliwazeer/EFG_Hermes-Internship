Sure, here's an example of a deployment manifest file in YAML format that you can include in your project's `README.md` file:

```markdown
# EFG Hermes Internship Deployment

This is a Kubernetes deployment manifest for the EFG Hermes Internship project.

## Deployment Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: efg-hermes-internship
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: efg-hermes-internship
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: efg-hermes-internship
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: efg-hermes-internship
        image: uliwazeer/efg-hermes-internship:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        

## Deployment Instructions

1. Install and configure Kubernetes on your local machine or cloud environment.
2. Save the above YAML manifest to a file, e.g., `efg-hermes-internship-deployment.yaml`.
3. Run the following commands to apply the deployment:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f efg-hermes-internship-deployment.yaml
   ```

4. Monitor the deployment progress and ensure that the pods are running successfully:

   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

5. Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application through the LoadBalancer service IP address:

   ```
   kubectl get service efg-hermes-internship
   ```

   The output will show the external IP address of the LoadBalancer service, which you can use to access the application.

Feel free to customize the deployment manifest as per your specific requirements. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
