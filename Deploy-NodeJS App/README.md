Kubernetes and a brief overview
A clear definition of Kubernetes is that it is a container orchestration tool that helps manage and organize 
your containerized microservices while scaling them. At scale, we mean horizontal/vertical scaling, auto-healing, load-balancing — high availability, 
and disaster recovery — rollbacks. The first thing we need to ponder with is our containers. These containers are more or less isolated and need to be properly managed; 
load balanced, distributed, and connected to the outside world.
